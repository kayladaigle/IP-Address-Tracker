## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location


### Links

- Live Site URL: [(https://your-live-site-url.com](https://kayladaigle.github.io/IP-Address-Tracker/)]

## My process

I started by implementing the html for this website and perfecting the css. I used CSS flexbox to set up the layout of the website. After this was completed, I completed a flow chart to help me visually understand how the IP mapping process should work. This was also my first project working with an API. I spent much of my time learning what an Application Programming Interface is and how I could use its data. I hope to work on more projects in the future that use API's so that I can become increasingly comfortable with them, as they are extremely valuable.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS media query for responsive layout
- Javascript
- IP Geolocation API
- Leaflet open-source Javascript library



### Continued development

I'm not yet comfortable using API's. My hope is that the more I work with them, the more I will break down their intimidating barriers. I also hope to improve my Javascript with every project.
